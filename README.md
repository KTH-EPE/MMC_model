# InterOPERA MMC Dynamic Tests Verification Framework

This repository provides an automated Python-based workflow for running and managing PSCAD simulations to assess the 
dynamic performance compliance of modular multi-level converters (MMCs) to the functional requirements stipulated in 
InterOPERA D2.1. A methodology for performing sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol' algorithm with a surrogate model (Bayessian 
Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion: BSPCE is also included.)
The framework supports parameter sweeps with systematic data export and post-processing.

## 1. Overview

The scripts in this project automate:

- Connection to PSCAD projects via the Python API
- Configuration of MMC control modes (active power, voltage control, droop control)
- Execution of different test scenarios:
  - Step changes in voltage reference
  - Step changes in active power reference
  - Power disturbances
  - Voltage disturbances
- Parameter sweeps over RLC grid equivalents
- Automatic extraction and storage of simulation results

The goal is to enable **reproducible, large-scale simulation studies** for HVDC and MMC-based grid-connected systems.

## 3. Experiment Types
- N.B: Manually launch PSCAD before initiating any test
### 3.1 Step Voltage Disturbance Response
- File: `run_step_voltage_disturbance_response.py`
- Purpose: To assess the open-loop quasi-static behavior of active power response to changes in DC voltage
- Control mode: Voltage droop control (`idmode = 2`)
- In the `config.py` file, set voltage level after a step (`step_voltage`)
---

### 3.2 Step Power Disturbance Response
- File: `run_step_power_disturbance_response.py`
- Purpose: 
  - To evaluate the closed-loop dynamics of the device under test (DUT) under various possible operational conditions. 
  - To assess whether the DUT possesses sufficient disturbance rejection capability to handle worst- case disturbances.
- Model includes full RLC equivalent of DC grid
---

### 3.3 Step Voltage Reference Response
- File: `run_step_voltage_reference_response.py`
- Purpose: To ensure the capability of the AC/DC converter unit to adhere to the DC voltage set-point at its DC-PoC at steady state
- Control mode: DC voltage control (`idmode = 0`)
---

### 3.4 Step Power Reference Response
- File: `run_step_power_reference_response.py`
- Purpose: Analyze active power tracking performance under reference changes
- Control mode: Active power control (`idmode = 1`)
---

### 3.5 Sensitivity analysis
- Sensitivity analysis assess the impact of the DC and AC grid parameters on control response.
- File: `SA_input_data_generator.py` generates sample data
- File: `step_voltage_reference_response_sim_for_SA.py` performs EMT simulations in PSCAD using the sample data.
- The KPI's from the EMT simulations are processed using file: `step_voltage_ref_response_result_analysis.ipynb` in the result analysis directory.
- Sobol sensitivity analysis is then performed using a surrogate PCE model with file: `SA_step_voltage_ref_response.py`.
---

## 4. Parameter Sweeps

All experiments support automated parameter sweeps over:

### Electrical parameters
- Inductance (L)
- Resistance (R)
- Capacitance (C)

### Sweep structure
- Full Cartesian product of selected parameter ranges
- Each simulation is executed independently
- Results are stored with structured file names

Example:
```
x_L400_C1300_R6_.csv
```
---

## 5. Configuration (config.yaml)

The simulation settings are centralized in `config.yaml` with the file required to run the simulation needing minimal 
updates. This ensures:

Reproducibility
Easy modification of test cases
Separation of code and experiment setup
---

## 6. Important!
Given the automation constraints in PSCAD,
- The DC grid RLC requivalent parameters should be named R_dc, L_dc, C_dc for the resistor, inductor, and capacitor respectively.
- Real constants in PSCAD for the power references should be named Pref_init, and P_ref_step for the initial and final 
power after a step respectively.
- Real constants in PSCAD for the voltage reference should be named "uref" and the final voltage after a step, "u_step".
- The source code should be adapted accordingly for different choices of parameter/component names and these parameters 
should be accessible on the main canvas of PSCAD.

## 7. Requirements & Installation
### 7.1 Python environment management (Poetry)

This project uses Poetry for dependency management and environment isolation.
Clone the project using

`git clone <repo-url>`

Change the directory to the "MMC_model"

 `cd MMC_model`

Install Poetry (if not already installed):

`pip install poetry`

Then install all dependencies:

`poetry install`

Activate the environment:

`.venv\Scripts\activate`

Run the tests in "mmc_tests" as desired

For sensitivity analysis, a different virtual environment is required due to conflicts in dependency versions.
Change the directory to "sensitivity_analysis"

`cd "MMC_model\\src\\sensitivity_analysis"`

Activate the virtual environment

`.venv\Scripts\activate`

Run `poetry install` to install dependencies. Poetry should already be installed in your system.

A numpy version < 2 should be installed. `Numpoly` should also be installed. In the event of issues, try 
`pip install --only-binary=:all: numpoly` followed by the installation of chaospy (`pip install chaospy`).

You'll then be ready to perform sensitivity analysis.
